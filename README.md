## The problem
Greenhouse farmers in the Netherlands are facing a structural absence of information. Especially a lack of awareness in terms of the water quality and biodiversity loss. 

## The idea
Our innovative idea is all about creating transparency for sustainability for greenhouse farmers and involving the society as an external co-creator for change. Therefore, we developed an idea for a gamified rewarding system to encourage farmers for less environmental harm while providing a way for supporting data collection. As a consequence, GHF can improve their finances (e.g. decreasing costs) as well as marketing (e.g. signaling that they care)!

## Usage of ESRI
We are using ESRI and ArcGIS.js to have access to the water quality data visually. 
That way we can spot correlations and possible defects in a greenhouses watermanagement and where we need more datapoints to improve our model.

## Usage of python geopandas 
With python geopandas we are preparing the data for Arcgis. 

Our steps from idea to solution:
1. Gathering data (official datasets & additional sources e.g. https://www-pdok-nl, https://www.schielandendekrimpenerwaard.nl/)
2. Cleaning and transforming data (jupyter notebooks using geo pandas  ![Map](measurements.py) )
3. Finding significant patterns (ESRI and ArcGIS)
4. Idea generation & prototype building
5. Presentation
